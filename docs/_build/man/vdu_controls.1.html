<h1 id="description">Description</h1>
<p><code>vdu_controls</code> is a virtual control panel for externally
connected VDU’s. The application detects DVI, DP, HDMI, or USB connected
VDU’s. It provides controls for settings such as brightness and
contrast.</p>
<p>The application interacts with VDU’s via the VESA <em>Display Data
Channel</em> (<em>DDC</em>) <em>Virtual Control Panel</em>
(<em>VCP</em>) commands set. DDC VCP interactions are mediated by the
<code>ddcutil</code> command line utility. <code>Ddcutil</code> provides
a robust interface that is tolerant of the vagaries of the many OEM DDC
implementations.</p>
<p>By default, <code>vdu_controls</code> offers a subset of controls
including brightness, contrast and audio controls. Additional controls
can be enabled via the <code>Settings</code> dialog.</p>
<p><code>vdu_controls</code> may optionally run as an entry in the
system tray of KDE, Deepin, GNOME, and Xfce (and possibly others). The
UI attempts to adapt to the quirks of the different tray
implementations.</p>
<p>Named <code>Preset</code> configurations can be saved for later
recalled. For example, a user could create presets for night, day,
photography, movies, and so forth.</p>
<p>The UI’s look-and-feel dynamically adjusts to the desktop theme.
Colors and icons automatically reconfigure without the need for a
restart when changing between light and dark themes.</p>
<p>A context menu containing this help is available by pressing the
right-mouse button either in the main control panel or on the
system-tray icon. The context menu is also available via a
hamburger-menu item on the bottom right of the main control panel.</p>
<p>Builtin laptop displays normally don’t implement DDC and those
displays are not supported, but a laptop’s externally connected VDU’s
are likely to be controllable.</p>
<p>Some controls change the number of connected devices (for example,
some VDU’s support a power-off command). If such controls are used,
<code>vdu_controls</code> will detect the change and will reconfigure
the controls for the new situation (for example, DDC VDU 2 may now be DD
VDU 1). If you change settings independently of
<code>vdu_controls</code>, for example, by using a VDU’s physical
controls, the <code>vdu_controls</code> UI includes a refresh button to
force it to assess the new configuration.</p>
<p>Note that some VDU settings may disable or enable other settings. For
example, setting a monitor to a specific picture-profile might result in
the contrast-control being disabled, but <code>vdu_controls</code> will
not be aware of the restriction resulting in its contrast-control erring
or appearing to do nothing.</p>
<h1 id="configuration">Configuration</h1>
<p>Configuration changes can be made via the <code>Settings</code>
dialog or via command line parameters (or by editing the config-files
directly). The command line provides an immediate way to temporarily
alter the behaviour of the application. The Settings-Dialog and config
files provide a more comprehensive and permanent solution for altering
the application’s configuration.</p>
<h2 id="settings-menu-and-config-files">Settings Menu and Config
files</h2>
<p>The right-mouse - context-menu - <code>Settings</code> accesses the
Settings dialog which can be used to customise the application by
writing to a set of config files. The <code>Settings</code> dialog
features a tab for editing a config file specific to each VDU. The
config files are named according to the following scheme:</p>
<ul>
<li>Application wide default config:
<code>$HOME/.config/vdu_controls/vdu_controls.conf</code></li>
<li>VDU model and serial number config:
<code>$HOME/.config/vdu_controls/&lt;model&gt;_&lt;serial|display_num&gt;.conf</code></li>
<li>VDU model only config:
<code>$HOME/.config/vdu_controls/&lt;model&gt;.conf</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The application wide default file can be used to alter application
settings and the set of default VDU controls.</p>
<p>The VDU-specific config files can be used to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Correct manufacturer built-in metadata.</li>
<li>Customise which controls are to be provided for each VDU.</li>
<li>Set an optimal <code>ddcutil</code> DDC communication
speed-multiplier for each VDU.</li>
</ul>
<p>It should be noted that config files can only be used to alter
definitions of VCP codes already supported by <code>ddcutil</code>. If a
VCP code is listed as a <em>manufacturer specific feature</em> it is not
supported. Manufacturer specific features should not be experimented
with, some may have destructive or irreversible consequences that may
brick the hardware. It is possible to enable any codes by creating a
<code>ddcutil</code> user definition (<code>--udef</code>) file, BUT
THIS SHOULD ONLY BE USED WITH EXTREME CAUTION AND CANNOT BE
RECOMMENDED.</p>
<p>The config files are in INI-format divided into a number of sections
as outlined below::</p>
<pre><code>[vdu-controls-globals]
# The vdu-controls-globals section is only required in $HOME/.config/vdu_controls/vdu_controls.conf
system-tray-enabled = yes|no
splash-screen-enabled = yes|no
warnings-enabled = yes|no
debug-enabled = yes|no
syslog-enabled = yes|no

[vdu-controls-widgets]
# Yes/no for each of the control options that vdu_controls normally provides by default.
brightness = yes|no
contrast = yes|no
audio-volume = yes|no
audio-mute = yes|no
audio-treble = yes|no
audio-bass = yes|no
audio-mic-volume = yes|no
input-source = yes|no
power-mode = yes|no
osd-language = yes|no

# Enable ddcutil supported codes not enabled in vdu_controls by default, CSV list of two-digit hex values.
enable-vcp-codes = NN, NN, NN

[ddcutil-parameters]
# Useful values appear to be &gt;=0.1
sleep-multiplier = 0.5

[ddcutil-capabilities]
# The (possibly edited) output from &quot;ddcutil --display N capabilities&quot; with leading spaces retained.
capabilities-override =</code></pre>
<p>As well as using the <code>Settings</code>, config files may also be
created by the command line option::</p>
<pre><code>vdu_controls --create-config-files</code></pre>
<p>which will create initial templates based on the currently connected
VDU’s.</p>
<p>The config files are completely optional, they need not be used if
the existing command line options are found to be adequate to the task
at hand.</p>
<h2 id="adding-value-restrictions-to-the-config-file">Adding value
restrictions to the config file</h2>
<p>If a VDU’s DDC reported feature minimum and maximum values are
incorrect, the vdu_controls user interface can be restricted to the
correct range. For example, say a VDU reports it supports a brightness
range of 0 to 100, but in fact only practically supports 20 to 90. In
such cases, this can be corrected by bringing up the vdu_controls
settings and editing that VDU’s <strong>capabilities
override</strong>:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>locate the feature, in this example the brightness,</li>
<li>add a <strong>Values:</strong> <strong><em>min..max</em></strong>
specification to line the following the feature definition,</li>
<li>save the changes.</li>
</ol>
<p>For the brightness example the completed edit would look like::</p>
<pre><code>Feature: 10 (Brightness)
    Values: 20..80</code></pre>
<p>The vdu_controls slider for that value will now be restricted to the
specified range.</p>
<h2 id="presets">Presets</h2>
<p>A custom named preset can be used to save the current VDU settings
for later recall. Any number of presets can be created to suit different
lighting conditions or different applications, for example:
<em>Night</em>, <em>Day</em>, <em>Overcast</em>, <em>Sunny</em>,
<em>Photography</em>, and <em>Video</em>.</p>
<p>Presets can be assigned a name and icon. If the current monitor
settings match a preset, the preset’s name will show in the window-title
and tray tooltip, the preset’s icon will overlay the normal tray
icon.</p>
<p>The <code>Presets</code> item in right-mouse
<code>context-menu</code> will bring up a <code>Presets</code> dialog
for managing and applying presets. The <code>context-menu</code> also
includes a shortcut for applying each existing presets.</p>
<p>Any small SVG or PNG can be selected as a preset’s icon. Monochrome
SVG icons that conform to the Plasma color conventions will be
automatically inverted if the desktop them is changed from dark to
light.</p>
<p>Each preset is stored in the application config directory as
<code>$HOME/.config/vdu_controls/Preset_&lt;preset_name&gt;.conf</code>.
Preset files are saved in INI-file format for ease of editing. Each
preset file contains a section for each connected VDU, for example::</p>
<pre><code>[preset]
icon = /usr/share/icons/breeze/status/16/cloudstatus.svg
solar-elevation = eastern-sky 40

[HP_ZR24w_CNT008]
brightness = 50
osd-language = 02

[LG_HDR_4K_89765]
brightness = 13
audio-speaker-volume = 16
input-source = 0f</code></pre>
<p>When the GUI is used to create a preset file, you can select which
controls to save. For example, you might create a preset that includes
only the brightness, but not the contrast or audio volume.</p>
<h2 id="presets---solar-elevation-triggers">Presets - solar elevation
triggers</h2>
<p>A preset may be set to automatically trigger when the sun rises to a
specified elevation. The idea being to allow a preset to trigger
relative to dawn or dusk, or when the sun rises above some surrounding
terrain (the time of which will vary as the seasons change).</p>
<p>To assign a trigger, use the Preset Dialog to set a preset’s
<code>solar-elevation</code>. A solar elevation may range from -19
degrees in the eastern sky (morning/ascending) to -19 degrees in the
western sky (afternoon/descending), with a maximum nearing 90 degrees at
midday.</p>
<p>If a preset has an elevation, it will be triggered each day at a time
calculated by using the latitude and longitude specified by in the
<code>vdu-controls-globals</code> <code>location</code> option.</p>
<p>By choosing an appropriate <code>solar-elevation</code> a preset may
be confined to specific times of the year. For example, a preset with a
positive solar elevation will not trigger at mid-winter in the Arctic
circle (because the sun never gets that high). Such a preset may always
be manually selected regardless of its specified solar elevations.</p>
<p>On any given day, the user may temporarily override any trigger, in
which case the trigger is suspended until the following day. For
example, a user might choose to disable a trigger intended for the
brightest part of the day if the day is particularly dull,</p>
<p>At startup <code>vdu_controls</code> will restore the most recent
preset that would have been triggered for this day (if any). For
example, say a user has <code>vdu_controls</code> set to run at login,
and they’ve also set a preset to trigger at dawn, but they don’t
actually log in until just after dawn, the overdue dawn preset will be
triggered at login.</p>
<h2 id="presets---remote-control">Presets - remote control</h2>
<p>UNIX/Linux signals may be used to instruct a running
<code>vdu_controls</code> to invoke a preset. This feature is provided
so that scripts, cron or systemd-timer might be used to change the
preset based on some measured condition appropriate for local
circumstances.</p>
<p>Signals in the range 40 to 55 correspond to first to last presets (if
any are defined). Additionally, SIGHUP can be used to initiate “Refresh
settings from monitors”. For example:</p>
<pre><code>Identify the running vdu_controls (assuming it is installed as /usr/bin/vdu_controls)::

    ps axwww | grep &#39;[/]usr/bin/vdu_controls&#39;

Combine this with kill to trigger a preset change::

    kill -40 $(ps axwww | grep &#39;[/]usr/bin/vdu_controls&#39; | awk &#39;{print $1}&#39;)
    kill -41 $(ps axwww | grep &#39;[/]usr/bin/vdu_controls&#39; | awk &#39;{print $1}&#39;)

Or if some other process has changed a monitors settings, trigger vdu_controls to update it&#39;s UI::

    kill -HUP $(ps axwww | grep &#39;[/]usr/bin/vdu_controls&#39; | awk &#39;{print $1}&#39;)</code></pre>
<p>Any other signals will be handled normally (in many cases they will
result in process termination).</p>
<p>Triggers that might be considered include the time of day, the
ambient light level, or the prevailing cloud conditions. For
example:</p>
<pre><code>* Ambient light level as measured by a webcam::

    ffmpeg -y -s 1024x768 -i /dev/video0 -frames 1 $HOME/tmp/out.jpg 1&gt;&amp;2
    ambient=$(convert $HOME/tmp/out.jpg -colorspace gray -resize 1x1 -evaluate-sequence Max -format &quot;%[fx:100*mean]&quot; info:)
    echo $ambient

* Local cloud conditions from https://github.com/chubin/wttr.in::

    curl &#39;wttr.in?format=%C&#39;

* Local time/sunrise/sunset again from wttr.in::

    curl &#39;wttr.in?format=&quot;dawn=%D,dusk=%d,weather=%C&quot;&#39;</code></pre>
<h2 id="responsiveness">Responsiveness</h2>
<p>If your VDU’s are modern, you may find a smaller sleep-multiplier
will speed up the <code>ddcutil</code>/VDU protocol exchanges making
both <code>ddcutil</code> and <code>vdu_controls</code> much more
responsive. In a multi-VDU setup where the VDU’s are quite different,
VDU config files can be used to specify individual multipliers (see
previous section).</p>
<p>Startup speed may be increased by creating VDU config files with
<code>capabilities-override</code> preset. Using an override eliminates
the need to run <code>ddcutil</code> to retrieve VDU capabilities. The
<code>--create-config-files</code> of context-menu settings-editor will
pre-populate <code>capabilities-override</code> for each connected
VDU.</p>
<p>Reducing the number of enabled controls can speed up the
initialisation and reduce the time taken when the refresh button is
pressed.</p>
<h1 id="examples">Examples</h1>
<pre><code>vdu_controls
    All default controls.

vdu_controls --show brightness --show contrast
    Specified controls only:

vdu_controls --hide contrast --hide audio-volume
    All default controls except for those to be hidden.

vdu_controls --system-tray --no-splash --show brightness --show audio-volume
    Start as a system tray entry without showing the splash-screen.

vdu_controls --create-config-files --system-tray --no-splash --show brightness --show audio-volume
    Create template config files in $HOME/.config/vdu_controls/ that include the other settings.

vdu_controls --enable-vcp-code 63 --enable-vcp-code 93 --warnings --debug
    All default controls, plus controls for VCP_CODE 63 and 93, show any warnings, output debugging info.

vdu_controls --sleep-multiplier 0.1
    All default controls, speed up ddcutil-VDU interaction by passing a sleep multiplier.</code></pre>
