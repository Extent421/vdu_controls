<h1 id="description">Description</h1>
<p><code>vdu_controls</code> is a virtual control panel for externally
connected VDU’s. The application detects DVI, DP, HDMI, or USB connected
VDU’s. It provides controls for settings such as brightness and
contrast.</p>
<p>The application interacts with VDU’s via the VESA <em>Display Data
Channel</em> (<em>DDC</em>) <em>Virtual Control Panel</em>
(<em>VCP</em>) commands set. DDC VCP interactions are mediated by the
<code>ddcutil</code> command line utility. <code>Ddcutil</code> provides
a robust interface that is tolerant of the vagaries of the many OEM DDC
implementations.</p>
<p>By default, <code>vdu_controls</code> offers a subset of controls
including brightness, contrast and audio controls. Additional controls
can be enabled via the <code>Settings</code> dialog.</p>
<p><code>vdu_controls</code> may optionally run as an entry in the
system tray of KDE, Deepin, GNOME, and Xfce (and possibly others). The
UI attempts to adapt to the quirks of the different tray
implementations.</p>
<p>Named <code>Preset</code> configurations can be saved for later
recall. For example, a user could create presets for night, day,
photography, movies, and so forth. Presets may be automatically
triggered according to solar elevation, and can be further constrained
by local weather conditions. Presets can be set to transition
immediately or gradually. Presets may also be activated by UNIX
signals.</p>
<p>The UI’s look-and-feel dynamically adjusts to the desktop theme.
Colors and icons automatically reconfigure without the need for a
restart when changing between light and dark themes.</p>
<p>A context menu containing this help is available by pressing the
right-mouse button either in the main control panel or on the
system-tray icon. The context menu is also available via a
hamburger-menu item on the bottom right of the main control panel.</p>
<p>Builtin laptop displays normally don’t implement DDC and those
displays are not supported, but a laptop’s externally connected VDU’s
are likely to be controllable.</p>
<p>Some controls change the number of connected devices (for example,
some VDU’s support a power-off command). If such controls are used,
<code>vdu_controls</code> will detect the change and will reconfigure
the controls for the new situation (for example, DDC VDU 2 may now be DD
VDU 1). If you change settings independently of
<code>vdu_controls</code>, for example, by using a VDU’s physical
controls, the <code>vdu_controls</code> UI includes a refresh button to
force it to assess the new configuration.</p>
<p>Note that some VDU settings may disable or enable other settings. For
example, setting a monitor to a specific picture-profile might result in
the contrast-control being disabled, but <code>vdu_controls</code> will
not be aware of the restriction resulting in its contrast-control erring
or appearing to do nothing.</p>

<h1 id="configuration">Configuration</h1>
<p>Configuration changes can be made via the <code>Settings</code>
dialog or via command line parameters (or by editing the config-files
directly). The command line provides an immediate way to temporarily
alter the behaviour of the application. The Settings-Dialog and config
files provide a more comprehensive and permanent solution for altering
the application’s configuration.</p>
<h2 id="settings-menu-and-config-files">Settings Menu and Config
files</h2>
<p>The right-mouse - context-menu - <code>Settings</code> accesses the
Settings dialog which can be used to customise the application by
writing to a set of config files. The <code>Settings</code> dialog
features a tab for editing a config file specific to each VDU. The
config files are named according to the following scheme:</p>
<ul>
<li>Application wide default config:
<code>$HOME/.config/vdu_controls/vdu_controls.conf</code></li>
<li>VDU model and serial number config:
<code>$HOME/.config/vdu_controls/&lt;model&gt;_&lt;serial|display_num&gt;.conf</code></li>
<li>VDU model only config:
<code>$HOME/.config/vdu_controls/&lt;model&gt;.conf</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The application wide default file can be used to alter application
settings and the set of default VDU controls.</p>
<p>The VDU-specific config files can be used to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Correct manufacturer built-in metadata.</li>
<li>Customise which controls are to be provided for each VDU.</li>
<li>Set an optimal <code>ddcutil</code> DDC communication
speed-multiplier for each VDU.</li>
</ul>
<p>It should be noted that config files can only be used to alter
definitions of VCP codes already supported by <code>ddcutil</code>. If a
VCP code is listed as a <em>manufacturer specific feature</em> it is not
supported. Manufacturer specific features should not be experimented
with, some may have destructive or irreversible consequences that may
brick the hardware. It is possible to enable any codes by creating a
<code>ddcutil</code> user definition (<code>--udef</code>) file, BUT
THIS SHOULD ONLY BE USED WITH EXTREME CAUTION AND CANNOT BE
RECOMMENDED.</p>
<p>The config files are in INI-format divided into a number of sections
as outlined below::</p>
<pre><code>[vdu-controls-globals]
# The vdu-controls-globals section is only required in $HOME/.config/vdu_controls/vdu_controls.conf
system-tray-enabled = yes|no
splash-screen-enabled = yes|no
translations-enabled = yes|no
weather-enabled = yes|no
schedule-enabled = yes|no
lux-options-enabled = yes|no
warnings-enabled = yes|no
debug-enabled = yes|no
syslog-enabled = yes|no

[vdu-controls-widgets]
# Yes/no for each of the control options that vdu_controls normally provides by default.
brightness = yes|no
contrast = yes|no
audio-volume = yes|no
audio-mute = yes|no
audio-treble = yes|no
audio-bass = yes|no
audio-mic-volume = yes|no
input-source = yes|no
power-mode = yes|no
osd-language = yes|no

# Enable ddcutil supported codes not enabled in vdu_controls by default, CSV list of two-digit hex values.
enable-vcp-codes = NN, NN, NN

[ddcutil-parameters]
# Useful values appear to be &gt;=0.1
sleep-multiplier = 0.5

[ddcutil-capabilities]
# The (possibly edited) output from &quot;ddcutil --display N capabilities&quot; with leading spaces retained.
capabilities-override =</code></pre>
<p>As well as using the <code>Settings</code>, config files may also be
created by the command line option::</p>
<pre><code>vdu_controls --create-config-files</code></pre>
<p>which will create initial templates based on the currently connected
VDU’s.</p>
<p>The config files are completely optional, they need not be used if
the existing command line options are found to be adequate to the task
at hand.</p>
<h2 id="adding-value-restrictions-to-the-config-file">Adding value
restrictions to the config file</h2>
<p>If a VDU’s DDC reported feature minimum and maximum values are
incorrect, the vdu_controls user interface can be restricted to the
correct range. For example, say a VDU reports it supports a brightness
range of 0 to 100, but in fact only practically supports 20 to 90. In
such cases, this can be corrected by bringing up the vdu_controls
settings and editing that VDU’s <strong>capabilities
override</strong>:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>locate the feature, in this example the brightness,</li>
<li>add a <strong>Values:</strong> <strong><em>min..max</em></strong>
specification to line the following the feature definition,</li>
<li>save the changes.</li>
</ol>
<p>For the brightness example the completed edit would look like::</p>
<pre><code>Feature: 10 (Brightness)
    Values: 20..80</code></pre>
<p>The vdu_controls slider for that value will now be restricted to the
specified range.</p>
<h2 id="presets">Presets</h2>
<p>A custom named preset can be used to save the current VDU settings
for later recall. Any number of presets can be created to suit different
lighting conditions or different applications, for example:
<em>Night</em>, <em>Day</em>, <em>Overcast</em>, <em>Sunny</em>,
<em>Photography</em>, and <em>Video</em>.</p>
<p>Presets can be assigned a name and icon. If the current monitor
settings match a preset, the preset’s name will show in the window-title
and tray tooltip, the preset’s icon will overlay the normal tray
icon.</p>
<p>The <code>Presets</code> item in right-mouse
<code>context-menu</code> will bring up a <code>Presets</code> dialog
for managing and applying presets. The <code>context-menu</code> also
includes a shortcut for applying each existing presets.</p>
<p>Any small SVG or PNG can be assigned as a preset’s icon. Monochrome
SVG icons that conform to the Plasma color conventions will be
automatically inverted if the desktop them is changed from dark to
light. If a preset lacks an icon, it will be assigned one created from
the letters of its name (the first letter of the first and last
words).</p>
<p>Presets may be set to transition immediately (the default); gradually
on schedule (solar elevation); or gradually always (when triggered by
schedule, context menu, or UNIX signal). The speed of transition is
determined by how quickly the VDU’s can respond to adjustment (which is
generally quite slowly). During a transition, the transition will be
abandoned if the controls involved in the transition are manually
altered, or another preset is manually invoked.</p>
<p>Each preset is stored in the application config directory as
<code>$HOME/.config/vdu_controls/Preset_&lt;preset_name&gt;.conf</code>.
Preset files are saved in INI-file format for ease of editing. Each
preset file contains a section for each connected VDU, for example::</p>
<pre><code>[preset]
icon = /usr/share/icons/breeze/status/16/cloudstatus.svg
solar-elevation = eastern-sky 40
transition-type = scheduled
transition-step-interval-seconds = 5

[HP_ZR24w_CNT008]
brightness = 50
osd-language = 02

[LG_HDR_4K_89765]
brightness = 13
audio-speaker-volume = 16</code></pre>
<p>When the GUI is used to create a preset file, you may select which
controls to save. For example, you might create a preset that includes
the brightness, but not the contrast or audio-volume. Keeping the
included controls to a minimum speeds up the transtion and reduces the
chances of the VDU failing to keep up with the associated stream of DDC
commands.</p>
<h2 id="presets---solar-elevation-triggers">Presets - solar elevation
triggers</h2>
<p>A preset may be set to automatically trigger when the sun rises to a
specified elevation. The idea being to allow a preset to trigger
relative to dawn or dusk, or when the sun rises above some surrounding
terrain (the time of which will vary as the seasons change).</p>
<p>To assign a trigger, use the Preset Dialog to set a preset’s
<code>solar-elevation</code>. A solar elevation may range from -19
degrees in the eastern sky (morning/ascending) to -19 degrees in the
western sky (afternoon/descending), with a maximum nearing 90 degrees at
midday.</p>
<p>If a preset has an elevation, it will be triggered each day at a time
calculated by using the latitude and longitude specified by in the
<code>vdu-controls-globals</code> <code>location</code> option.</p>
<p>By choosing an appropriate <code>solar-elevation</code> a preset may
be confined to specific times of the year. For example, a preset with a
positive solar elevation will not trigger at mid-winter in the Arctic
circle (because the sun never gets that high). Such a preset may always
be manually selected regardless of its specified solar elevations.</p>
<p>On any given day, the user may temporarily override any trigger, in
which case the trigger is suspended until the following day. For
example, a user might choose to disable a trigger intended for the
brightest part of the day if the day is particularly dull,</p>
<p>At startup <code>vdu_controls</code> will restore the most recent
preset that would have been triggered for this day (if any). For
example, say a user has <code>vdu_controls</code> set to run at login,
and they’ve also set a preset to trigger at dawn, but they don’t
actually log in until just after dawn, the overdue dawn preset will be
triggered at login.</p>
<h2 id="presets---smooth-transitions">Presets - Smooth Transitions</h2>
<p>A preset may be set to <code>Transition Smoothly</code>, in which
case changes to controls slider controls such as brightness and contrast
will be stepped by one until the final values are reached. Any
non-continuous values will be set after all continuous values have
reached their final values.</p>
<p>The Preset Dialog includes controls to set a Preset’s transition type
to a combination these values:</p>
<pre><code>* ``None`` transition, values change immediately;
* ``On schedule`` according to a solar elevation trigger;
* ``On signal`` on the appropriate UNIX signal;
* ``On menu`` when selected in the context-menu;</code></pre>
<p>In the Presets Dialog, the preset activation and edit buttons will
activate any preset immediately regardless of the transition
settings.</p>
<p>Normally a transition single-steps the controls as quickly as
possible. In practice this means each step takes one or more seconds and
increases linearly depending on the number of VDU’s and number of
controls being altered. The Presets Dialog includes a
<code>Transition Step seconds</code> control that can be used to
increase the step interval and extend a transition over a longer period
of time.</p>
<p>If any transitioning controls change independently of the transition,
the transition will cease. In that manner a transition can be abandoned
by dragging a slider or choosing a different preset.</p>
<h2 id="presets---supplementary-weather-requirements">Presets -
supplementary weather requirements</h2>
<p>A solar elevation trigger can have a weather requirement which will
be checked against the weather reported by https://wttr.in.</p>
<p>By default, there are three possible weather requirements:
<code>good</code>, <code>bad</code>, and <code>all weather</code>. Each
requirement is defined by a file containing a list of WWO
(https://www.worldweatheronline.com) weather codes, one per line. The
three default requirements are contained in the files
<code>$HOME/.config/vdu_controls/{good,bad,all}.weather</code>.
Additional weather requirements can be created by using a text editor to
create further files. The <code>all.weather</code> file exists primarily
as a convenient resource that lists all possible codes.</p>
<p>Because reported current weather conditions may be inaccurate or out
of date, it’s best to use weather requirements as a coarse measure.
Going beyond good and bad may not be very practical. What’s possible
might depend on you local weather conditions.</p>
<p>To ensure <code>wttr.in</code> supplies the weather for your
location, please ensure that <code>Settings</code> <code>Location</code>
includes a place-name suffix. The <code>Settings</code>
<code>Location</code> <code>Detect</code> button has been enhanced to
fill out a place-name for you. Should <code>wttr.in</code> not recognise
a place-name, the place-name can be manually edited to something more
suitable. The nearest big city or an airport-code will do, for example:
LHR, LAX, JFK. You can use a web browser to test a place-name, for
example: https://wttr.in/JFK</p>
<p>When weather requirements are in use, <code>vdu_controls</code> will
check that the coordinates in <code>Settings</code>
<code>Location</code> are a reasonable match for those returned from
<code>wttr.in</code>, a warning will be issued if they are more than 200
km (124 miles) apart.</p>
<p>If the place-name is left blank, the <code>wttr.in</code> server will
try to guess you location from your external IP address. The guess may
vary due to the state of the <code>wttr.in</code> server. It’s best to
fill out a place-name to ensure stable results.</p>
<h2 id="presets---remote-control">Presets - remote control</h2>
<p>UNIX/Linux signals may be used to instruct a running
<code>vdu_controls</code> to invoke a preset. This feature is provided
so that scripts, cron or systemd-timer might be used to change the
preset based on some measured condition appropriate for local
circumstances.</p>
<p>Signals in the range 40 to 55 correspond to first to last presets (if
any are defined). Additionally, SIGHUP can be used to initiate “Refresh
settings from monitors”. For example:</p>
<pre><code>Identify the running vdu_controls (assuming it is installed as /usr/bin/vdu_controls)::

    ps axwww | grep &#39;[/]usr/bin/vdu_controls&#39;

Combine this with kill to trigger a preset change::

    kill -40 $(ps axwww | grep &#39;[/]usr/bin/vdu_controls&#39; | awk &#39;{print $1}&#39;)
    kill -41 $(ps axwww | grep &#39;[/]usr/bin/vdu_controls&#39; | awk &#39;{print $1}&#39;)

Or if some other process has changed a monitors settings, trigger vdu_controls to update it&#39;s UI::

    kill -HUP $(ps axwww | grep &#39;[/]usr/bin/vdu_controls&#39; | awk &#39;{print $1}&#39;)</code></pre>
<p>Any other signals will be handled normally (in many cases they will
result in process termination).</p>
<p>Triggers that might be considered include the time of day, the
ambient light level, or the prevailing cloud conditions. For
example:</p>
<pre><code>* Ambient light level as measured by a webcam::

    ffmpeg -y -s 1024x768 -i /dev/video0 -frames 1 $HOME/tmp/out.jpg 1&gt;&amp;2
    ambient=$(convert $HOME/tmp/out.jpg -colorspace gray -resize 1x1 -evaluate-sequence Max -format &quot;%[fx:100*mean]&quot; info:)
    echo $ambient

* Local cloud conditions from https://github.com/chubin/wttr.in::

    curl &#39;wttr.in?format=%C&#39;

* Local time/sunrise/sunset again from wttr.in::

    curl &#39;wttr.in?format=&quot;dawn=%D,dusk=%d,weather=%C&quot;&#39;</code></pre>
<h2 id="lightlux-metering">Light/Lux Metering</h2>
<p><code>vdu_controls</code> can a hardware lux metering device to
adjust VDU brightness according to a specified lux/brightness
profile.</p>
<p>The Settings Dialog includes an option enable lux metering options.
When enabled, the Content Menu will include Light Meter option to access
a Light-Meter Dialog. The dialog can be used to define the metering
device and the Lux Brightness Response Profile for each VDU.</p>
<p>The metering device must a readable character device, a UNIX fifo
(named-pipe), or a runnable script. The character device or fifo must
periodically supply one floating point lux reading per line. Each line
must be terminated by carriage-return newline (character device) or just
newline (fifo/named-pipe). The runnable script will be run each time a
value is needed, it must output a single line containing a lux
value.</p>
<p>Possible hardware devices include the GY-30/BH1750 lux meter wired to
an Arduino which may act as a character device. It may be possible use
webcam/camera output to compute an approximate lux value, ether by
analysing image content, or examining image settings that contribute to
exposure such ISO values, apertures, and shutter speed, the result could
be feed to a fifo.</p>
<p>Example scripts for mapping webcam average brightness to approximate
lux values are available in
<code>/usr/share/vdu_controls/sample-scripts/</code> or they can be
downloaded from
https://github.com/digitaltrails/vdu_controls/tree/master/sample-scripts.
They will require customising for your own webcam and lighting
conditions.</p>
<p>In creating an “lux meter” for used with vdu_controls, theres is no
need to produce standard lux values. It is sufficient to produce
log10-like values from 1 to 10000 that can be used to create a VDU
profile that changes according to your own ambient conditions. Metered
values need not be continuous, a set of appropriate stepped values might
serve just as well as a continuous measure. Potential step values might
include typical lux values, for example:</p>
<pre><code>Lighting conditions and lux values::

    sunlight       100000
    daylight        10000
    overcast         1000
    sunrise/sunset    400
    dark-overcast     100
    living-room        50
    night               5</code></pre>
<p>Due to VDU hardware and DDC protocal limitations, gradual/stepping
changes in brightness are quite likely to noticeable and potentially
annoying. The auto-brightness adjustment feature includes several
measures to dampen minimise the amount of stepping:</p>
<pre><code>* Lux/Brightness Profiles define brightness-steps so that
  brightness levels remain constant over set ranges of lux values.
* Adjustments are only made at intervals of one or more minutes.
* Large adjustments are made with larger step sizes to shorten the transition period.
* The adjustment task passes lux values through a smoothing low-pass filter.</code></pre>
<p>If light-levels are changing frequently and extremely, for example,
as the sun passes behind a succession of clouds, the main panel,
context-menu, and light-metering dialog each contain Manual/Auto
controls for disabling/enabling lux metering. Additionally, you might
tune the lux/brightness profile to eliminate the issue. Achieving an
acceptable profile will require some experimentation.</p>
<p>The Light Meter dialog includes an option to enable interpolation of
brightness values with each Profile step. Enabling this option doesn’t
change the frequency of lux-measurements, but during periods where
ambient light levels are changing, the option may generate more
adjustments.</p>
<p>Light metering settings and profiles are stored in::</p>
<pre><code>$HOME/.config/vdu_controls/AutoLux.conf</code></pre>
<p>A typical example follows::</p>
<pre><code>[lux-meter]
automatic-brightness = yes
lux-device = /dev/ttyUSB0
interval-minutes = 2

[lux-profile]
hp_zr24w_cnt008 = [(1, 90), (29, 90), (926, 100), (8414, 100), (100000, 100)]
lg_hdr_4k_8 = [(1, 13), (60, 25), (100, 50), (299, 70), (1000, 90), (10000, 100), (100000, 100)]

[lux-presets]
lux-preset-points = [(0, &#39;Night&#39;), (60, &#39;Brighter-Night&#39;), (250, &#39;Cloudy&#39;), (1000, &#39;Sunny&#39;)]</code></pre>
<h2 id="lightlux-metering-and-presets">Light/Lux Metering and
Presets</h2>
<p>The Light-Meter Dialog includes the ability to set a Preset to
trigger at a lux value. This feature is accessed by hovering under the
bottom axis of the Lux Profile Chart.</p>
<p>When a Preset is tied to a lux value, the Preset’s VDU brightness
values become fixed points on the Lux Profile Chart. When the specified
metered lux value is achieved, the metered stepping process will restore
the Preset’s brightness values and then follow that by triggering the
Preset’s full restoration. This ordering of events reduces the
likelihood of metered-stepping, and Preset-restoration from
clashing.</p>
<p>A Preset that does not include a VDU’s brightness may be attached to
a lux point to restore one or more non-brightness controls. For example,
on reaching a particular lux level, an attached Preset might restore a
contrast setting.</p>
<p>If a Preset is attached to a lux value and then detached, the
Preset’s profile points will be converted to normal (editable) profile
points. Attach/detach is a quick way to copy VDU brightness values from
Presets if you don’t want to permanently attach them.</p>
<p>If you utilise light-metered auto-brightness and Preset-scheduling
together, their combined effects may conflict. For example, a scheduled
Preset may set a reduced brightness, but soon after, light-metering
might increase it. If you wish to use the two together, design your
lux/brightness profile steps to match the brightness levels of specific
Presets, for example, a full-sun Preset and the matching step in a
lux/brightness Profile might both be assigned the same brightness
level.</p>
<p>The Preset Diolog includes an option to enable auto-brightness
interpolation. When enabled, this option will calculate values between
steps in the profiles. Interpolation won’t change the auto-brightness
value if the change would be less than 10%. During interpolation, if the
smoothed metered lux value is found to be in proximity to any
profile-attached Preset, the Preset will be preferred over
interpolation.</p>
<h2 id="lux-metering-internal-parameters">Lux Metering Internal
Parameters</h2>
<p>The following internal constants can be altered by manually editing
<code>~/.config/vdu_controls/AutoLux.conf</code>. They guide the various
metering and auto-adjustment heuristics::</p>
<pre><code>  [lux-meter]
  # How many times per minute to sample from the Lux meter (for auto-adjustment)
  samples-per-minute=3
  # How many samples to include in the smoothing process
  smoother-n=5
  # How heavily should past values smooth the present value (smaller = more smoothing)
  # See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-pass_filter#Simple_infinite_impulse_response_filter
  smoother-alpha=0.5
  # If an interpolated value yields a change in brightness, how big should the change
  # be to trigger an actual VDU change in brightness? Also determines how close
  # an interpolated value needs to be to a an attached Preset&#39;s brightness in order
  # to prefer triggering the preset over applying the interpolated value.

Response Time: Dynamic Optimization and Sleep Multipliers</h2>
<p>For versions of <code>ddcutil</code> prior to 2.0, you can manually
set the <code>vdu_control</code> <code>sleep-multiplier</code> passed to
<code>ddcutil</code>. A sleep multiplier less than one will speed up the
i2c protocol interactions at the risk of increased protocol errors. The
default sleep multiplier of 1.0 has to be quite conservative, many VDU’s
can cope with smaller multipliers. A bit of experimentation with
multiplier values may greatly speed up responsiveness. In a multi-VDU
setup individual sleep multipliers can be configured (see previous
section).</p>
<p>If you are using <code>ddcutil</code> version 2.0 or greater,
<code>vdu_controls</code> will default to using the <code>ddcutil</code>
dynamic sleep optimiser. The optimiser automatically tunes and caches
VDU specific timings when ever <code>ddcutil</code> is run. Should you
encounter any reliability-issues or errors, they may well be
automatically resolved as <code>ddcutil</code> refines it’s cached
timings.</p>
<p>If dynamic sleep is available, <code>vdu_controls</code> will
override any existing existing global or VDU-specific sleep multipliers
specified in the <code>Settings Dialog</code>, these multipliers will
now only be applied if the <code>ddcutil</code> version is less than
2.0. This behavior may be countermanded by disabling dynamic sleep in
the <code>vdu_controls</code> global settings. If countermanded, each
VDU’s set sleep multiplier will be be used for all versions of
<code>ddcutil</code>, but dynamic sleep may still be selectively applied
to each VDU by setting its multiplier to zero.</p>
<h2 id="improving-response-time-connections-and-controls">Improving
Response Time: Connections and Controls</h2>
<p><code>DDC/I2C</code> is not the speediest or most reliable form of
communication. VDU’s may vary in their responsiveness and compliance.
GPU’s, GPU drivers, and types of connection may affect the reliability.
If you have the choice, <code>DisplayPort</code> can be more reliable
than <code>DVI</code> or <code>HDMI</code>.</p>
<p>Reducing the number of enabled controls can speed up initialisation,
reduce the time taken when the refresh button is pressed, and reduce the
time taken to restore presets.</p>
<p>There’s plenty of useful info for getting the best out of
<code>ddcutil</code> at https://www.ddcutil.com/.</p>
<h1 id="examples">Examples</h1>
<pre><code>vdu_controls
    All default controls.

vdu_controls --show brightness --show contrast
    Specified controls only:

vdu_controls --hide contrast --hide audio-volume
    All default controls except for those to be hidden.

vdu_controls --system-tray --no-splash --show brightness --show audio-volume
    Start as a system tray entry without showing the splash-screen.

vdu_controls --create-config-files --system-tray --no-splash --show brightness --show audio-volume
    Create template config files in $HOME/.config/vdu_controls/ that include the other settings.

vdu_controls --enable-vcp-code 63 --enable-vcp-code 93 --warnings --debug
    All default controls, plus controls for VCP_CODE 63 and 93, show any warnings, output debugging info.</code></pre>
<p>This script often refers to displays and monitors as VDU’s in order
to disambiguate the noun/verb duality of “display” and “monitor”</p>
<h1 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h1>
<p>Described for OpenSUSE, similar for other distros:</p>
<p>Software::</p>

    zypper install ddcutil</code></pre>
<p>Kernel Modules::</p>
<pre><code>    modprobe i2c_dev
    lsmod | grep i2c_dev</code></pre>
<p>Get ddcutil working first. Check that the detect command detects your
VDU’s without issuing any errors:</p>
<pre><code>    ddcutil detect</code></pre>
<p>Read ddcutil readme concerning config of i2c_dev with nvidia GPU’s.

<p>If you wish to use a serial-port lux metering device, the
<code>pyserial</code> module is a runtime requirement.</p>
<h1 id="environment">Environment</h1>
<pre><code>LC_ALL, LANG, LANGUAGE
    These  variables specify the locale for language translations and units
    of distance. LC_ALL is used by python, LANGUAGE is used by Qt.
    Normally, they should all have the same value, for example: ``Da_DK``.
    For these to have any effect on language, ``Settings`` ``Translations Enabled``
    must also be enabled.

VDU_CONTROLS_IPINFO_URL
    This variable overrides the default ip-address to location service
    URL (``https://ipinfo.io/json``).

VDU_CONTROLS_WTTR_URL
    This variable overrides default weather service URL (``https://wttr.in``).

VDU_CONTROLS_WEATHER_KM
    This variable overrides the default maximum permissible spherical
    distance (in kilometres) between the ``Settings`` ``Location``
    and ``wttr.in`` reported location (``200 km``, 124 miles).

VDU_CONTROLS_DDCUTIL_ARGS
    This variable adds to the list of arguments passed to each exec of
    ddcutil.

VDU_CONTROLS_DEVELOPER
    This variable changes some search paths to be more convenient in
    a development scenario. (``no`` or yes)</code></pre>
