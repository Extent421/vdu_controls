<h1 id="description">Description</h1>
<p><code>vdu_controls</code> is a virtual control panel for physically connected VDU’s. It displays a set of controls for each DVI/DP/HDMI/USB connected VDU and uses the <code>ddcutil</code> command line utility to issue <em>Display Data Channel</em> (<em>DDC</em>) <em>Virtual Control Panel</em> (<em>VCP</em>) commands to each of them. The intent is not to provide a comprehensive set of controls but rather to provide a simple panel with a selection of essential controls for the desktop.</p>
<p>A context menu containing this help is available by pressing the right-mouse button either in the main user interface or on the system-tray icon. <code>vdu_controls</code> may be run as a system-tray entry by using the <code>--system-tray</code> option.</p>
<p>By default <code>vdu_controls</code> offers a subset of possible controls including brightness and contrast. Further controls can be added by using the <code>--enable-vcp-code</code> option to add any other codes supported by <code>ddcutil</code>. The full list of VCP codes supported by <code>ddcutil</code> can be listed by running <code>ddcutil vcpinfo --verbose</code>. For example, the VCP code 66 is listed as an on/off control for an ambient light sensor, this can be enabled for <code>vdu_controls</code> by passing <code>--enable-vcp-code 66</code> (the control will only appear in the user interface if the VDU reports that it has that capability).</p>
<p>Builtin laptop displays normally don’t implement DDC and those displays are not supported, but a laptop’s externally connected VDU’s are likely to be controllable.</p>
<p>Some controls change the number of connected devices (for example, some VDU’s support a power-off command). If such controls are used, <code>vdu_controls</code> will detect the change and will restart itself to reconfigure the controls for the new situation (for example, DDC VDU 2 may now be DD VDU 1). Similarly, if you physically unplug monitor, the same thing will happen.</p>
<p>Note that some VDU settings may disable or enable other settings. For example, setting a monitor to a specific picture-profile might result in the contrast-control being disabled, but <code>vdu_controls</code> will not be aware of the restriction resulting in its contrast-control appearing to do nothing.</p>
<h1 id="configuration">Configuration</h1>
<p>Configuration is supplied via command line parameters and config-files. The command line provides an immediate way to temporarily alter the behaviour of the application. The config files provide a more comprehensive and permanent solution for altering the application’s configuration.</p>
<h2 id="settings-menu-and-config-files">Settings Menu and Config files</h2>
<p>The right-mouse context-menu <code>Settings</code> item can be used to customise the application by writing to a set of config files. The <code>Settings</code> item will feature a tab for editing each config file. The config files are named according to the following scheme:</p>
<pre><code>- Application wide default config: ``$HOME/.config/vdu_controls/vdu_controls.conf``
- VDU model and serial number config: ``$HOME/.config/vdu_controls/&lt;model&gt;_&lt;serial|display_num&gt;.conf``
- VDU model only config: ``$HOME/.config/vdu_controls/&lt;model&gt;.conf``</code></pre>
<p>The application wide default file can be used to alter application settings and the set of default VDU controls.</p>
<p>The VDU-specific config files can be used to:</p>
<pre><code>- Correct manufacturer built-in meta data.
- Customise which controls are to be provided for each VDU.
- Set a optimal ``ddcutil`` DDC communication speed-multiplier for each VDU.</code></pre>
<p>It should be noted that config files can only be used to alter definitions of VCP codes already supported by <code>ddcutil</code>. If a VCP code is listed as a <em>manufacturer specific feature</em> it is not supported. Manufacturer specific features should not be experimented with, some may have destructive or irreversible consequences that may brick the hardware. It is possible to enable any codes by creating a <code>ddcutil</code> user definition (<code>--udef</code>) file, BUT THIS SHOULD ONLY BE USED WITH EXTREME CAUTION AND CANNOT BE RECOMMENDED.</p>
<p>The config files are in INI-format divided into a number of sections as outlined below:</p>
<pre><code>    # The vdu-controls-globals section is only required in $HOME/.config/vdu_controls/vdu_controls.conf
    [vdu-controls-globals]
    system-tray-enabled = yes|no
    splash-screen-enabled = yes|no
    warnings-enabled = yes|no
    debug-enabled = yes|no

    [vdu-controls-widgets]
    # Yes/no for each of the control options that vdu_controls normally provides by default.
    brightness = yes|no
    contrast = yes|no
    audio-volume = yes|no
    audio-mute = yes|no
    audio-treble = yes|no
    audio-bass = yes|no
    audio-mic-volume = yes|no
    input-source = yes|no
    power-mode = yes|no
    osd-language = yes|no
    # The enable-vcp-codes option is a list of two-digit hex values in CSV format.
    # This option enables ddcutil supported codes that are not in the default set provided by vdu_controls.
    enable-vcp-codes = NN, NN, NN

    [ddcutil-parameters]
    # Useful values appear to be &gt;=0.1
    sleep-multiplier = 0.5

    [ddcutil-capabilities]
    # The (possibly edited) output from &quot;ddcutil --display N capabilities&quot; with leading spaces retained.
    capabilities-override =</code></pre>
<p>As well as using the <code>Settings</code>, config files may also be created by the command line option</p>
<pre><code>    vdu_controls --create-config-files</code></pre>
<p>which will create initial templates based on the currently connected VDU’s.</p>
<p>The config files are completely optional, they need not be used if the existing command line options are found to be adequate to the task at hand.</p>
<h2 id="presets">Presets</h2>
<p>A custom named preset can be used to save the current VDU settings for later recall. Any number of presets can be created to suit different lighting conditions or different applications, for example: <em>Night</em>, <em>Day</em>, <em>Overcast</em>, <em>Sunny</em>, <em>Photography</em>, and <em>Video</em>.</p>
<p>The <code>Presets</code> item in right-mouse <code>context-menu</code> will bring up a dialog for managing and applying presets. The <code>context-menu</code> also includes a shortcut for applying each existing presets.</p>
<p>The preset files are named as follows:</p>
<pre><code>``$HOME/.config/vdu_controls/Preset_&lt;preset_name&gt;.conf``</code></pre>
<p>Presets are saved in INI-file format for ease of editing. Each preset file contains a section for each connected VDU, something similar to the following example:</p>
<pre><code>    [HP_ZR24w_CNT008]
    brightness = 50
    osd-language = 02

    [LG_HDR_4K_Display2]
    brightness = 13
    audio-speaker-volume = 16
    input-source = 0f</code></pre>
<p>Whe the GUI is used to create a preset file it saves a value for every VDU and every visible control. A preset file need not include all VDu’s or settings, it can be manually edited to remove VDU’s and settings that aren’t desired.</p>
<h2 id="responsiveness">Responsiveness</h2>
<p>If your VDU’s are modern, you may find a smaller sleep-multiplier will speed up the <code>ddcutil</code>/VDU protocol exchanges making both <code>ddcutil</code> and <code>vdu_controls</code> much more responsive. In a multi-VDU setup where the VDU’s are quite different, VDU config files can be used to specify individual multipliers (see previous section).</p>
<p>Startup speed may be increased by creating VDU config files with <code>capabilities-override</code> preset. Using an override eliminates the need to run <code>ddcutil</code> to retrieve VDU capabilities. The <code>--create-config-files</code> of context-menu settings-editor will pre-populate <code>capabilities-override</code> for each connected VDU.</p>
<p>Reducing the number of enabled controls can speed up the initialisation and reduce the time taken when the refresh button is pressed.</p>
<h1 id="examples">Examples</h1>
<pre><code>vdu_controls
    All default controls.

vdu_controls --show brightness --show contrast
    Specified controls only:

vdu_controls --hide contrast --hide audio-volume
    All default controls except for those to be hidden.

vdu_controls --system-tray --no-splash --show brightness --show audio-volume
    Start as a system tray entry without showing the splash-screen.

vdu_controls --create-config-files --system-tray --no-splash --show brightness --show audio-volume
    Create template config files in $HOME/.config/vdu_controls/ that include the other settings.

vdu_controls --enable-vcp-code 63 --enable-vcp-code 93 --warnings --debug
    All default controls, plus controls for VCP_CODE 63 and 93, show any warnings, output debugging info.

vdu_controls --sleep-multiplier 0.1
    All default controls, speed up ddcutil-VDU interaction by passing a sleep multiplier.</code></pre>
<p>This script often refers to displays and monitors as VDU’s in order to disambiguate the noun/verb duality of “display” and “monitor”</p>
