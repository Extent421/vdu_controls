.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBvdu_controls\fP is a virtual control panel for externally connected VDU\(aqs.  The application detects
DVI, DP, HDMI, or USB connected VDU\(aqs.  It provides controls for settings such as brightness and contrast.
.sp
The application interacts with VDU\(aqs via the VESA \fIDisplay Data Channel\fP (\fIDDC\fP) \fIVirtual Control Panel\fP  (\fIVCP\fP)
commands set.  DDC VCP interactions are mediated by the \fBddcutil\fP command line utility.  \fBDdcutil\fP provides
a robust interface that is tolerant of the vagaries of the many OEM DDC implementations.
.sp
By default, \fBvdu_controls\fP offers a subset of controls including brightness, contrast and audio controls.  Additional
controls can be enabled via the \fBSettings\fP dialog.
.sp
\fBvdu_controls\fP may optionally run as an entry in the system tray of KDE, Deepin, GNOME, and Xfce (and possibly
others). The UI attempts to adapt to the quirks of the different tray implementations.
.sp
Named \fBPreset\fP configurations can be saved for later recall. For example, a user could create
presets for night, day, photography, movies, and so forth.  Presets may be automatically triggered
according to solar elevation, and can be further constrained by local weather conditions. Presets can
be set to transition immediately or gradually.  Presets may also be activated by UNIX signals.
.sp
The UI\(aqs look\-and\-feel dynamically adjusts to the desktop theme.  Colors and icons automatically
reconfigure without the need for a restart when changing between light and dark themes.
.sp
A context menu containing this help is available by pressing the right\-mouse button either in the main
control panel or on the system\-tray icon.  The context menu is also available via a hamburger\-menu item on the
bottom right of the main control panel.
.sp
Builtin laptop displays normally don\(aqt implement DDC and those displays are not supported, but a laptop\(aqs
externally connected VDU\(aqs are likely to be controllable.
.sp
Some controls change the number of connected devices (for example, some VDU\(aqs support a power\-off command). If
such controls are used, \fBvdu_controls\fP will detect the change and will reconfigure the controls
for the new situation (for example, DDC VDU 2 may now be DD VDU 1).  If you change settings independently of
\fBvdu_controls\fP, for example, by using a VDU\(aqs physical controls,  the \fBvdu_controls\fP UI includes a refresh
button to force it to assess the new configuration.
.sp
Note that some VDU settings may disable or enable other settings. For example, setting a monitor to a specific
picture\-profile might result in the contrast\-control being disabled, but \fBvdu_controls\fP will not be aware of
the restriction resulting in its contrast\-control erring or appearing to do nothing.
.SH CONFIGURATION
.sp
Configuration changes can be made via the \fBSettings\fP dialog or via command line parameters (or by editing the
config\-files directly).  The command line provides an immediate way to temporarily alter the behaviour of
the application. The Settings\-Dialog and config files provide a more comprehensive and permanent
solution for altering the application\(aqs configuration.
.SS Settings Menu and Config files
.sp
The right\-mouse \- context\-menu \- \fBSettings\fP accesses the Settings dialog which can be used to
customise the application by writing to a set of config files.  The \fBSettings\fP dialog features a tab for
editing a config file specific to each VDU.  The config files are named according
to the following scheme:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Application wide default config: \fB$HOME/.config/vdu_controls/vdu_controls.conf\fP
.IP \(bu 2
VDU model and serial number config: \fB$HOME/.config/vdu_controls/<model>_<serial|display_num>.conf\fP
.IP \(bu 2
VDU model only config: \fB$HOME/.config/vdu_controls/<model>.conf\fP
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The application wide default file can be used to alter application settings and the set of default VDU controls.
.sp
The VDU\-specific config files can be used to:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Correct manufacturer built\-in metadata.
.IP \(bu 2

.IP \(bu 2
Set an optimal \fBddcutil\fP DDC communication speed\-multiplier for each VDU.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
It should be noted that config files can only be used to alter definitions of VCP codes already supported
by \fBddcutil\fP\&.  If a VCP code is listed as a \fImanufacturer specific feature\fP it is not supported. Manufacturer
specific features should not be experimented with, some may have destructive or irreversible consequences that
may brick the hardware. It is possible to enable any codes by  creating a  \fBddcutil\fP user
definition (\fB\-\-udef\fP) file, BUT THIS SHOULD ONLY BE USED WITH EXTREME CAUTION AND CANNOT BE RECOMMENDED.
.sp
The config files are in INI\-format divided into a number of sections as outlined below:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[vdu\-controls\-globals]
# The vdu\-controls\-globals section is only required in $HOME/.config/vdu_controls/vdu_controls.conf
system\-tray\-enabled = yes|no
splash\-screen\-enabled = yes|no
translations\-enabled = yes|no
warnings\-enabled = yes|no
debug\-enabled = yes|no
syslog\-enabled = yes|no

[vdu\-controls\-widgets]
# Yes/no for each of the control options that vdu_controls normally provides by default.
brightness = yes|no

audio\-volume = yes|no
audio\-mute = yes|no
audio\-treble = yes|no
audio\-bass = yes|no

# The (possibly edited) output from \(dqddcutil \-\-display N capabilities\(dq with leading spaces retained.
capabilities\-override =
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
As well as using the \fBSettings\fP, config files may also be created by the command line option:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
vdu_controls \-\-create\-config\-files
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
which will create initial templates based on the currently connected VDU\(aqs.
.sp
The config files are completely optional, they need not be used if the existing command line options are found to be
adequate to the task at hand.
.SS Adding value restrictions to the config file
.sp
If a VDU\(aqs DDC reported feature minimum and maximum values are incorrect,
the vdu_controls user interface can be restricted to the correct range. For example,
say a VDU reports it supports a brightness range of 0 to 100, but in fact only
practically supports 20 to 90. In such cases, this can be corrected by bringing up
the vdu_controls settings and editing that VDU\(aqs \fBcapabilities override\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 1. 3
locate the feature, in this example the brightness,
.IP 2. 3
add a __Values:__ \fB*min..max*\fP specification to line the following the feature definition,
.IP 3. 3
save the changes.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
For the brightness example the completed edit would look like:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
Feature: 10 (Brightness)
    Values: 20..80
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The vdu_controls slider for that value will now be restricted to the specified range.
.SS Presets
.sp
A custom named preset can be used to save the current VDU settings for later recall. Any number of presets can be
created to suit different lighting conditions or different applications, for example: \fINight\fP, \fIDay\fP, \fIOvercast\fP,
\fISunny\fP, \fIPhotography\fP, and \fIVideo\fP\&.
.sp
Presets can be assigned a name and icon.  If the current monitor settings match a preset, the preset\(aqs name will show
in the window\-title and tray tooltip, the preset\(aqs icon will overlay the normal tray icon.
.sp
The \fBPresets\fP item in right\-mouse \fBcontext\-menu\fP will bring up a \fBPresets\fP dialog for managing and applying
presets.  The \fBcontext\-menu\fP also includes a shortcut for applying each existing presets.
.sp
Any small SVG or PNG can be assigned as a preset\(aqs icon.  Monochrome SVG icons that conform to the Plasma color
conventions will be automatically inverted if the desktop them is changed from dark to light. If a preset lacks
an icon, it will be assigned one created from the letters of its name (the first letter of the first and last words).
.sp
Presets may be set to transition immediately (the default); gradually on schedule (solar elevation); or gradually
always (when triggered by schedule, context menu, or UNIX signal).  The speed of transition is determined by
how quickly the VDU\(aqs can respond to adjustment (which is generally quite slowly).  During a transition,
the transition will be abandoned if the controls involved in the transition are manually altered, or another
preset is manually invoked.
.sp
Each preset is stored in the application config directory as \fB$HOME/.config/vdu_controls/Preset_<preset_name>.conf\fP\&.
Preset files are saved in INI\-file format for ease of editing.  Each preset file contains a section for each connected
VDU, for example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[preset]
icon = /usr/share/icons/breeze/status/16/cloudstatus.svg
solar\-elevation = eastern\-sky 40
transition\-type = scheduled
transition\-step\-interval\-seconds = 5

[HP_ZR24w_CNT008]
brightness = 50
osd\-language = 02

[LG_HDR_4K_89765]
brightness = 13
audio\-speaker\-volume = 16
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
When the GUI is used to create a preset file, you may select which controls to save.  For example, you
might create a preset that includes the brightness, but not the contrast or audio\-volume. Keeping
the included controls to a minimum speeds up the transtion and reduces the chances of the VDU failing
to keep up with the associated stream of DDC commands.
.SS Presets \- solar elevation triggers
.sp
A preset may be set to automatically trigger when the sun rises to a specified elevation.
The idea being to allow a preset to trigger relative to dawn or dusk, or when the sun rises
above some surrounding terrain (the time of which will vary as the seasons change).
.sp
To assign a trigger, use the Preset Dialog to set a preset\(aqs \fBsolar\-elevation\fP\&.
A solar elevation may range from \-19 degrees in the eastern sky (morning/ascending)
to \-19 degrees in the western sky (afternoon/descending), with a maximum nearing
90 degrees at midday.
.sp
If a preset has an elevation, it will be triggered each day at a time calculated
by using the latitude and longitude specified by in the \fBvdu\-controls\-globals\fP
\fBlocation\fP option.
.sp
By choosing an appropriate \fBsolar\-elevation\fP a preset may be confined to specific
times of the year.  For example, a preset with a positive solar elevation will
not trigger at mid\-winter in the Arctic circle (because the sun never gets that
high).  Such a preset may always be manually selected regardless of its specified
solar elevations.
.sp
On any given day, the user may temporarily override any trigger, in which case the
trigger is suspended until the following day.  For example, a user might choose to
disable a trigger intended for the brightest part of the day if the day is particularly
dull,
.sp
At startup \fBvdu_controls\fP will restore the most recent preset that would have been
triggered for this day (if any).  For example, say a user has \fBvdu_controls\fP
set to run at login, and they\(aqve also set a preset to trigger at dawn, but
they don\(aqt actually log in until just after dawn, the overdue dawn preset will be
triggered at login.
.SS Presets \- Smooth Transitions
.sp
A preset may be set to \fBTransition Smoothly\fP, in which case changes to controls
slider controls such as brightness and contrast will be stepped by one until the
final values are reached.  Any non\-continuous values will be set after all continuous
values have reached their final values.
.sp
The Preset Dialog includes controls to set a Preset\(aqs transition to one
of three values:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBNo\fP transition, change values immediately;
.IP \(bu 2
\fBOn schedule\fP according to a solar elevation trigger;
.IP \(bu 2
\fBAlways\fP either by selection in the context menu or by solar elevation.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The preset activation and edit buttons in the Presets Dialog will activate any
preset immediately regardless of the transition settings.
.sp
Normally a transition single\-steps the controls as quickly as possible.  In practice
this means each step takes one or more seconds and increases linearly depending on the
number of VDU\(aqs and number of controls being altered.  The Presets Dialog includes
a \fBTransition Step seconds\fP control that can be used to increase the step interval
and extend a transition over a longer period of time.
.sp
If any transitioning controls change independently of the transition, the
transition will cease.  In that manner a transition can be abandoned by dragging
a slider or choosing a different preset.
.SS Presets \- supplementary weather requirements
.sp
A solar elevation trigger can have a weather requirement which will be checked
against the weather reported by \fI\%https://wttr.in\fP\&.
.sp
By default, there are three possible weather requirements: \fBgood\fP,
\fBbad\fP, and \fBall weather\fP\&.  Each  requirement is defined by a
file containing a list of WWO (\fI\%https://www.worldweatheronline.com\fP) weather
codes, one per line.  The three default requirements are contained in
the files \fB$HOME/.config/vdu_controls/{good,bad,all}.weather\fP\&.  Additional
weather requirements can be created by using a text editor to create further
files.  The \fBall.weather\fP file exists primarily as a convenient resource
that lists all possible codes.
.sp
Because reported current weather conditions may be inaccurate or out of date,
it\(aqs best to use weather requirements as a coarse measure. Going beyond good
and bad may not be very practical.  What\(aqs possible might depend on you local
weather conditions.
.sp
To ensure \fBwttr.in\fP supplies the weather for your location, please ensure
that \fBSettings\fP \fBLocation\fP includes a place\-name suffix.  The \fBSettings\fP
\fBLocation\fP \fBDetect\fP button has been enhanced to fill out a place\-name for
you.  Should \fBwttr.in\fP not recognise a place\-name, the place\-name can be
manually edited to something more suitable. The nearest big city or an
airport\-code will do, for example: LHR, LAX, JFK.  You can use a web browser
to test a place\-name, for example: \fI\%https://wttr.in/JFK\fP
.sp
When weather requirements are in use, \fBvdu_controls\fP will check that the
coordinates in \fBSettings\fP \fBLocation\fP are a reasonable match for
those returned from \fBwttr.in\fP, a warning will be issued if they are more
than 200 km (124 miles) apart.
.sp
If the place\-name is left blank, the \fBwttr.in\fP server will try to guess
you location from your external IP address.  The guess may vary due to
the state of the \fBwttr.in\fP server. It\(aqs best to fill out a place\-name
to ensure stable results.
.SS Presets \- remote control
.sp
UNIX/Linux signals may be used to instruct a running \fBvdu_controls\fP to invoke a preset.  This feature is
provided so that scripts, cron or systemd\-timer might be used to change the preset based on some measured
condition appropriate for local circumstances.
.sp
Signals in the range 40 to 55 correspond to first to last presets (if any are defined).  Additionally, SIGHUP can
be used to initiate \(dqRefresh settings from monitors\(dq.  For example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Identify the running vdu_controls (assuming it is installed as /usr/bin/vdu_controls):
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
ps axwww | grep \(aq[/]usr/bin/vdu_controls\(aq
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Combine this with kill to trigger a preset change:
.INDENT 0.0

.sp
.nf
.ft C
kill \-40 $(ps axwww | grep \(aq[/]usr/bin/vdu_controls\(aq | awk \(aq{print $1}\(aq)
kill \-41 $(ps axwww | grep \(aq[/]usr/bin/vdu_controls\(aq | awk \(aq{print $1}\(aq)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Or if some other process has changed a monitors settings, trigger vdu_controls to update it\(aqs UI:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp

.SS Responsiveness
.sp
If your VDU\(aqs are modern, you may find a smaller sleep\-multiplier will speed up the \fBddcutil\fP/VDU protocol
exchanges making both \fBddcutil\fP and \fBvdu_controls\fP much more responsive.  In a multi\-VDU setup where the VDU\(aqs
are quite different, VDU config files can be used to specify individual multipliers (see previous section).
.sp
Startup speed may be increased by creating VDU config files with \fBcapabilities\-override\fP preset. Using an
override eliminates the need to run \fBddcutil\fP to retrieve VDU capabilities.  The \fB\-\-create\-config\-files\fP
of context\-menu settings\-editor will pre\-populate \fBcapabilities\-override\fP for each connected VDU.
.sp
Reducing the number of enabled controls can speed up the initialisation and reduce the time taken when the
refresh button is pressed.
