.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBvdu_controls\fP is a virtual control panel for physically connected VDU\(aqs.  It displays a set of controls for
each  DVI/DP/HDMI/USB connected VDU and uses the \fBddcutil\fP command line utility to issue \fIDisplay Data Channel\fP
(\fIDDC\fP) \fIVirtual Control Panel\fP  (\fIVCP\fP) commands to each of them. The intent is not to provide a comprehensive set
of controls but rather to provide a simple panel with a selection of essential controls for the desktop.
.sp
A context menu containing this help is available by pressing the right\-mouse button either in the main user interface
or on the system\-tray icon.  \fBvdu_controls\fP may be run as a system\-tray entry by using the \fB\-\-system\-tray\fP option.
.sp
By default, \fBvdu_controls\fP offers a subset of possible controls including brightness and contrast.  Additional controls
can be added by using the \fB\-\-enable\-vcp\-code\fP option to add any other codes supported by \fBddcutil\fP\&.  The full list
of VCP codes supported by \fBddcutil\fP can be listed by running \fBddcutil vcpinfo \-\-verbose\fP\&. For example, the
VCP code 66 is listed as an on/off control for an ambient light sensor, this can be enabled for \fBvdu_controls\fP by
passing \fB\-\-enable\-vcp\-code 66\fP (the control will only appear in the user interface if the VDU reports that it
has that capability).
.sp
Builtin laptop displays normally don\(aqt implement DDC and those displays are not supported, but a laptop\(aqs
externally connected VDU\(aqs are likely to be controllable.
.sp
Some controls change the number of connected devices (for example, some VDU\(aqs support a power\-off command). If
such controls are used, \fBvdu_controls\fP will detect the change and will restart itself to reconfigure the controls
for the new situation (for example, DDC VDU 2 may now be DD VDU 1).  Similarly, if you physically unplug monitor, the
same thing will happen.
.sp
Note that some VDU settings may disable or enable other settings. For example, setting a monitor to a specific
picture\-profile might result in the contrast\-control being disabled, but \fBvdu_controls\fP will not be aware of
the restriction resulting in its contrast\-control erring or appearing to do nothing.
.SH CONFIGURATION
.sp
Configuration is supplied via command line parameters and config\-files.  The command line provides an immediate way
to temporarily alter the behaviour of the application. The config files provide a more comprehensive and permanent
solution for altering the application\(aqs configuration.
.SS Settings Menu and Config files
.sp
The right\-mouse context\-menu \fBSettings\fP item can be used to customise the application by writing to a set of config
files.  The \fBSettings\fP item will feature a tab for editing each config file.  The config files are named according
to the following scheme:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Application wide default config: \fB$HOME/.config/vdu_controls/vdu_controls.conf\fP
.IP \(bu 2
VDU model and serial number config: \fB$HOME/.config/vdu_controls/<model>_<serial|display_num>.conf\fP
.IP \(bu 2
VDU model only config: \fB$HOME/.config/vdu_controls/<model>.conf\fP
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The application wide default file can be used to alter application settings and the set of default VDU controls.
.sp
The VDU\-specific config files can be used to:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Correct manufacturer built\-in metadata.
.IP \(bu 2
Customise which controls are to be provided for each VDU.
.IP \(bu 2
Set an optimal \fBddcutil\fP DDC communication speed\-multiplier for each VDU.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
It should be noted that config files can only be used to alter definitions of VCP codes already supported
by \fBddcutil\fP\&.  If a VCP code is listed as a \fImanufacturer specific feature\fP it is not supported. Manufacturer
specific features should not be experimented with, some may have destructive or irreversible consequences that
may brick the hardware. It is possible to enable any codes by  creating a  \fBddcutil\fP user
definition (\fB\-\-udef\fP) file, BUT THIS SHOULD ONLY BE USED WITH EXTREME CAUTION AND CANNOT BE RECOMMENDED.
.sp
The config files are in INI\-format divided into a number of sections as outlined below:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[vdu\-controls\-globals]
# The vdu\-controls\-globals section is only required in $HOME/.config/vdu_controls/vdu_controls.conf
system\-tray\-enabled = yes|no
splash\-screen\-enabled = yes|no
warnings\-enabled = yes|no
debug\-enabled = yes|no
syslog\-enabled = yes|no

[vdu\-controls\-widgets]
# Yes/no for each of the control options that vdu_controls normally provides by default.
brightness = yes|no
contrast = yes|no
audio\-volume = yes|no
audio\-mute = yes|no
audio\-treble = yes|no
audio\-bass = yes|no
audio\-mic\-volume = yes|no
input\-source = yes|no
power\-mode = yes|no
osd\-language = yes|no

# Enable ddcutil supported codes not enabled in vdu_controls by default, CSV list of two\-digit hex values.
enable\-vcp\-codes = NN, NN, NN

[ddcutil\-parameters]
# Useful values appear to be >=0.1
sleep\-multiplier = 0.5

# The (possibly edited) output from "ddcutil \-\-display N capabilities" with leading spaces retained.
capabilities\-override =
.ft P

.sp
As well as using the \fBSettings\fP, config files may also be created by the command line option:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
vdu_controls \-\-create\-config\-files
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
which will create initial templates based on the currently connected VDU\(aqs.
.sp
The config files are completely optional, they need not be used if the existing command line options are found to be
adequate to the task at hand.
.SS Adding value restrictions to the config file
.sp
If a VDU\(aqs DDC reported feature minimum and maximum values are incorrect,
the vdu_controls user interface can be restricted to the correct range. For example,
say a VDU reports it supports a brightness range of 0 to 100, but in fact only
practically supports 20 to 90. In such cases, this can be corrected by bringing up
the vdu_controls settings and editing that VDU\(aqs \fBcapabilities override\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 1. 3
locate the feature, in this example the brightness,
.IP 2. 3
add a __Values:__ \fB*min..max*\fP specification to line the following the feature definition,
.IP 3. 3
save the changes.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
For the brightness example the completed edit would look like:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
Feature: 10 (Brightness)
    Values: 20..80
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The vdu_controls slider for that value will now be restricted to the specified range.
.SS Presets
.sp
A custom named preset can be used to save the current VDU settings for later recall. Any number of presets can be
created to suit different lighting conditions or different applications, for example: \fINight\fP, \fIDay\fP, \fIOvercast\fP,
\fISunny\fP, \fIPhotography\fP, and \fIVideo\fP\&.
.sp
Presets can be assigned a name and icon.  If the current monitor settings match a preset, the preset\(aqs name will show
in the window\-title and tray tooltip, the preset\(aqs icon will overlay the normal tray icon.
.sp
The \fBPresets\fP item in right\-mouse \fBcontext\-menu\fP will bring up a dialog for managing and applying presets.
The \fBcontext\-menu\fP also includes a shortcut for applying each existing presets. Any small SVG or PNG can be
selected as a preset\(aqs icon.  Monochrome SVG icons that conform to the Plasma color conventions will be automatically
inverted if the desktop them is changed from dark to light.
.sp
The preset files are named as follows: \fB$HOME/.config/vdu_controls/Preset_<preset_name>.conf\fP
.sp
Presets are saved in INI\-file format for ease of editing.  Each preset file contains a section for each connected
VDU, something similar to the following example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[preset]
icon = /usr/share/icons/breeze/status/16/cloudstatus.svg

[HP_ZR24w_CNT008]
brightness = 50
osd\-language = 02

[LG_HDR_4K_Display2]
brightness = 13
audio\-speaker\-volume = 16
input\-source = 0f
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Whe the GUI is used to create a preset file it saves a value for every VDU and every visible control.  A preset
file need not include all VDu\(aqs or settings, it can be manually edited to remove VDU\(aqs and settings that aren\(aqt
desired.
.SS Presets \- remote control
.sp
UNIX/Linux signals may be used to instruct a running \fBvdu_controls\fP to invoke a preset.  This feature is
provided so that scripts, cron or systemd\-timer might be used to change the preset based on some measured
condition appropriate for local circumstances.
.sp
Signals in the range 40 to 55 correspond to first to last presets (if any are defined).  Additionally, SIGHUP can
be used to initiate "Refresh settings from monitors".  For example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Identify the running vdu_controls (assuming it is installed as /usr/bin/vdu_controls):
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
ps axwww | grep \(aq[/]usr/bin/vdu_controls\(aq
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Combine this with kill to trigger a preset change:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
kill \-40 $(ps axwww | grep \(aq[/]usr/bin/vdu_controls\(aq | awk \(aq{print $1}\(aq)
kill \-41 $(ps axwww | grep \(aq[/]usr/bin/vdu_controls\(aq | awk \(aq{print $1}\(aq)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Or if some other process has changed a monitors settings, trigger vdu_controls to update it\(aqs UI:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
kill \-HUP $(ps axwww | grep \(aq[/]usr/bin/vdu_controls\(aq | awk \(aq{print $1}\(aq)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Any other signals will be handled normally (in many cases they will result in process termination).
.sp
Triggers that might be considered include the time of day, the ambient light level, or the prevailing
cloud conditions. For example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Ambient light level as measured by a webcam:
.INDENT 2.0
.INDENT 3.5

.SS Responsiveness
.sp
If your VDU\(aqs are modern, you may find a smaller sleep\-multiplier will speed up the \fBddcutil\fP/VDU protocol
exchanges making both \fBddcutil\fP and \fBvdu_controls\fP much more responsive.  In a multi\-VDU setup where the VDU\(aqs
are quite different, VDU config files can be used to specify individual multipliers (see previous section).
.sp
Startup speed may be increased by creating VDU config files with \fBcapabilities\-override\fP preset. Using an
override eliminates the need to run \fBddcutil\fP to retrieve VDU capabilities.  The \fB\-\-create\-config\-files\fP
of context\-menu settings\-editor will pre\-populate \fBcapabilities\-override\fP for each connected VDU.
.sp
Reducing the number of enabled controls can speed up the initialisation and reduce the time taken when the
refresh button is pressed.
